# Family Game Night Communicator
An app to communicate via COM port (bluetooth for example) to send and receive data from a device. In this project an Arduino board. See Arduino folder for the setup and functionality of the board.



## TODO
* Sending signals should wait before last is ready (otherwise Arduino can get in a fault state)
* Set timer mode, so the gamehost can see which player was first
* Add some led shows
